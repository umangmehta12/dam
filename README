Compilation and Execution Steps:

[1] Extract the contents of submission package.

[2] Once you have extracted the contents of the submission package 
    you should have all the files in the required folder. 
    (Keep the directory structure as it is.)

[3] To compile the software your present working directory
    should be the folder containing the program. 

[4] Then execute the command shown below; to setup the enviroment for
    executing the software.
    
    make

    (Keep the directory structure as it is after compilation.)
[5] Run the dam shell file with the following command format:
    
    ./dam -f <pathname> -f <pathname>
    ./dam -d <pathname> -d <pathname>
    ./dam -f <pathname> -d <pathname>
    ./dam -d <pathname> -f <pathname>
    
    where <pathname> is a Linux path name. If a <pathname> is
    preceded by "-f", then the <pathname> must end in ".wav" or
    ".mp3" or ".ogg" and must name a file that already exists on 
    the CCIS shared file system. If a <pathname> is preceded 
    by "-d", it must name a directory that already exists on 
    the CCIS shared file system and contains nothing but 
    files whose pathnames would be legal following a 
    "-f"option.

    Based on the input provided the output will be displayed.

[6] To restore back the previus state before the use of software
    execute the command shown below;

   make clean

Credits for 3rd party Software used:

[1] For performing FFT, We have used the following third 
    party source code

    https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~ronw/code/MEAPsoft/doc/html/FFT
    _8java-source.html

    As per the instructor’s note (Java source code for FFT) on 
    piazza on 15th October 2014, we have been granted 
    permission by professor and authorized to use this code 
    in our project.

[2] For converting the input recording to canonical form.
    We have used following third party softwares;
    (i)   oggdec 
    (ii)  lame
    (iii) wav

(Note: Specification of our canonical form our defination 
       for the canonical form is wav file with sampling rate 
       of 44100 samples/second in mono mode with bit-width of 
       16 bits/seconds.)
